current settings I've been using for wsnet testing:

<simulation>
    nodes = determined by density
    (I've been using:
    density 1: 32, density 2: 64, density 3: 95, density 4: 127,
    density 5: 159, density 6: 191, density 7: 223, density 8: 255,
    density 9: 286, density 10: 318, density 11: 350, density 12: 382,
    density 13: 414, density 14: 446, density 15: 477, density 16: 509,
    density 17: 541, density 18: 573, density 19: 605, density 20: 637)
    duration = 20s (way more time than needed, but the simulator skips time when
no events are scheduled, so it doesn't hurt.  If you don't put the 's' after the
number, specifying seconds, then the time is read as nanoseconds)
    x = 10
    y = 10
    z = 0

Propagation:
<propagation_range>
    range = 1

Interferences:
<interferences_none>

Modulation:
<modulation_none>

no moniter

no noise

Antenna:
<antenna_omnidirectionnal>
    delete all parameters and use default values
(note: in the xml-parser they misspelled omnidirectional with the extra
'n' like I did here, this is written into the form.xml, just don't try and
correct it. TODO: fix that)

Radio:
<radio_half1d>
    delete all parameters and use default values
(note: it would probably be better to use a real radio than whatever this is,
look into switching models)

MAC:
<mac_idealmac>
    range = 1

Routing:
determined by what is being tested

Application:
determined by what is being tested

Mobility:
<mobility_static>
    delete all parameters and use default values

Battery:
<energy_ideal_battery>

Environment:
    for propogation entry re-enter range number, should match what is specified
in propagation module. (no, I don't know why you have to specify it twice)

everything else should be specified in the form.xml file.  Mess with it at
your own risk.
